This is a functional programming "kernel" - hence its the name "kernel.py". 

It provides : 
 • some building blocks for function currying and easy function composition
   through a kind of monadic class "F", rop and op partial operator objects and
   other helper functions.

 • miscellaneous utilities to be used from the command line like quickly
   reading or writing file, manipulating files, or editing some snippet of code
   in a external editor and then running it in the current context.
